# codingtrainwreck_3.1
3 had snake working but it really was a trainwreck so restarting it fresh.  (though probably not now...)

since I've made some 'graphics' in sketchup -a spritesheet or two - it really made less sense to continue the project as it was - so I am restarting it.  It should take not too much time the second round through. *looksaround*

i npm'd p5-manager... I'm not sure i like it as it is... its slick and all but just not what I need - right now. 

moved into instantiation mode to eliminate global vars as much as possible.  I wouldn't say that p5js way of doing this makes that much sense to me. 

apparently instance mode forces you to pass the p5 instance to everything... I really don't understand that.  The only way I can rationalize that is that p5js is really just to play and not meant as an actual framework for projects. BUT I admit I coiuld be wrong and this opinion may change
